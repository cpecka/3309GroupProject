As stated in the comments, when inserting into the db, you only have to copy and paste the contents of each of the eight text files into a mysql editor.
Obviously, the db must be created first
The data in the current txt files is what we used to complete the other exercises
The information must be loaded in the following order:
1. Doctor
2. Medical Equipment
3. Room
4. Patient
5. Room Schedule
6. Equipment Schedule
7. Staff Schedule
8. Reservations *

*This is special. Read the comments below the snippet of code for generating reservations for more info. You will have to manually add times to the reservation txt file
